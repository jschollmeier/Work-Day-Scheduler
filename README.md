This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. When the planner is opened the current day is displayed at the top. As you scroll down there are bloacks for every hour of the work day. As each hour passes the past hours turn grey the current hour block is red and the future hour blocks are green. Inside these blocks you can type to do items or meetings or what ever you want to plan during your day . Then by clicking the appropriate save button the data is saved to local storage to be redisplayed even after the page is refreshed.

This uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
